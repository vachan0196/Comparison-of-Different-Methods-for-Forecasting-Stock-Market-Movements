# Comparison-of-Different-Methods-for-Forecasting-Stock-Market-Movements
A master's thesis project exploring various statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for stock price forecasting using historical data from Meta Platforms Inc. Models include ARIMA, ARIMAX, Linear Regression, Random Forest, CNN, RNN, and LSTM, with ARIMAX yielding the best results.

This repository contains my master's thesis project on forecasting stock market prices using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The project focused on historical data from Meta Platforms Inc., evaluating models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). ARIMAX with exogenous variables demonstrated the best accuracy, achieving the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE). The study highlights the significance of external variables and model selection in dynamic financial markets.
